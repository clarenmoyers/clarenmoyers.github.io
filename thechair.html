			<p>The focus of the design studio entitled “objects and spaces” was to design a tool for sitting in a specified context. The project employed the design process, research, iterations, 3D rendering, scale modeling, drafting/drawing, and presentation skills. The final deliverables for the course were a detailed process notebook, presentation materials, and a to-scale functional prototype. My tool for sitting was designed specifically for the Student Activities Center at the University of Texas but more broadly for all newly created university spaces meant for student use and collaboration. My goal was to create efficient and streamlined seating options that can be modified and arranged to accommodate the fast turnover of students in any large, public space.

			<p>College students today exist in spaces where the intentions of the university do not align with student needs physically. Modern spaces, such as the SAC, GDC, and ERC on the University of Texas at Austin campus have been created with the intentions of appeasing the group, the public, and the reputation of the university. The individual student becomes ignored. The challenge is to take back the space for the individual student and provide them with control over their environment and security over their personal space.

			<p>The design process that the tool for sitting went through had the key element of combining the desk and chair into one through all iterations. I ran into structural issues with supporting a “floating” or unsupported edge and implementing complex curves. In the end, I lowered my seat to the ground and expanded its dimensions in order to make a seated floor desk that can be approached from many sides and used with many different postures such as sitting, squatting, kneeling, or leaning. The shape and material of the final design also imply the ability to reconfigure the seating into the desired position which gives the student the power to choose to sit alone or in small groups.

				<p>The functional prototype I created was completed out of MDF wood and used two support beams on the outside floating edge that are not part of the final design, which is envisioned to be made out of molded fiberglass with dense foam and upholstery for padding. In the final materials, the chair would be incredibly light and durable which allows for the intended use of individual control over the space and movability of the furniture to become a reality. If I were to continue iterating on this chair design, I would focus in on long-term wear of materials and watch how students actually use this furniture in spaces in order to test how to objectives of this chair transition into reality through user testing.
