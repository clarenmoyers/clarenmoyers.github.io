			<p>This project was based around creating an infographic for an “ecosystem” that we each chose for our semester-long focus and an ephemeral piece that paired with the infographic. My chosen ecosystem was Levittown, NY, which was one of the first planned communities in America in the 1950s. I chose to center my exploration of this ecosystem around the functions and expectations of family life in this setting and use my infographic to highlight the ways in which these single-family houses encoded a structure of society that has stuck as the ideal social structure up to today. Modern circumstances, however, have made this encoded goal harder and harder to attain for the average American.

			<p>My infographic took the form of a pop-up board book of a typical 1950s Levittown home. Each scene opens up onto a different and stereotypical home scene gathered from propaganda and advertisements from this era. I subverted the messages these images portray through having reveal panels behind each figure that show the imperfect stereotypes and fears that strict middle-class society had in the time such as drug addiction, counter-culture movements, sexual freedom, and anti-christian beliefs.

			<p>The ephemeral piece that I paired with my infographic was a set of jello salads using 1950s style figurines instead of “floaters” in the salads. Jello salads came into popularity during the world war two ration era but continued to be a popular and economical way to eat leftovers and cheaper food through the 1950s. The ironic spin is that what once was a fast, easy, and cheap war food turned into a centerpiece in American homes that housewives slaved over to garnish and form into intricate shapes to please the family and husband. Trapping these women, literally and metaphorically, within their own creations in the home.
