			<p>“Fashion Loop” is a project created as the final semester project for a typography class. The goal of the project was to format a large body of text, in this case, articles based on the environmental issue we had each chosen for the semester. My focus was on waste from fast fashion, specifically what happens behind the scenes in the manufacturing and waste management systems. I chose to set two different articles, one focused on the systemic issues we face and the burden placed onto clothing donation centers and the other focused on providing guidelines for creating a closed and sustainable fashion loop. Links to the full articles can be found HERE.

			<p>I chose to set my type onto clothing sourced second-hand using screen printing and a flexible grid system. The grid system that I created allows for individual paragraphs of texts to function independently from one another and be screen printed either alone or in chunks depending on the size and shape of the clothing item being printed on. Each section of the grid had a project title, number, paragraph of text, and a link to the full article. This allowed me to be able to spread the message of fashion sustainability more widely as any piece of fabric could be printed on in some way that still is able to provide information.

			<p>In order to capture the ephemeral nature of clothing, I scanned the screen printed clothing and turned them into a set of posters that can be framed and read in a more lasting way than the clothing itself which will be returned into the clothing loop to be bought again, worn, or recycled for scraps.
